              Hi there! I am a passionate learner on a coding journey through SheCodes and self-guided exploration. My background boasts over 10 years of professional experience, with a significant chunk of my career dedicated to the dynamic world of Communications, especially designing events through the perspective of the user's experience and facilitating meetings with Graphic Recording's service. In 2017, though, I made a great change and I dedicated my days to planting organic food and herbs in agroforestry systems - an ancestral way to cultivate an abundant variety of species in one ecosystem, proving that diversity leads plants - and humans - to thrive. Healthy soil, healthy plants, healthy fauna, healthy humans. That experience has allowed me to deeply connect to nature and people, whose simplicity inspired me. Nurtured, I made another great change and I have been studying frontend development since 2023. My skill set includes expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and responsive design, enabling me to build responsive and visually appealing websites. I am becoming proficient in utilizing Bootstrap framework to expedite development processes and ensure efficient and scalable web solutions. I am fluent in Portuguese, English and Spanish, and have some knowledge in Japanese as well - by the way, yes, I am a japanese descendent, although I haven't been in Japan yet. In Brazil we have the biggest japanese community outside of Japan, around 2 million people. - This linguistic ability allows me to effectively collaborate with diverse teams and I absolutely love knowing more about different cultures. Driven by a passion for continuous learning and innovation, I thrive in dynamic and diverse environments where challenges lead to growth. My commitment to delivering high-quality work and my love for problem-solving make me a valuable asset to any development project. 
              <br />
              If you are seeking a dedicated, skilled, and multilingual developer who is eager to contribute to your team's success, I would be thrilled to collaborate with you. Let's bring your web development projects to life together! Looking forward to connecting and discussing how I can be a great fit for your web development needs.
